--- The Live Post that I created ---
As I've said before, CrewAI Flows are wonderful for AI Automation which means you can have pure Python code, integrate LLM calls or have multiple crews. One of the more powerful parts of the system is State Management...at least in my opinion. 

In my latest video, I'll walk you through how to build a fully automated AI Workout Planner using CrewAI Flows and Composio. In just 7 steps, you'll go from zero to a working AI system that:

✅ Creates a Google Drive folder for your workouts
✅ Researches and summarizes personalized workout plans
✅ Generates Google Docs and Sheets from that research
✅ Saves everything to your Drive folder
✅ Sends the finished workout plan directly to a Slack channel

📽️ Video Preview - Here's what we'll build together:

🛠️ Step 1: Set up your CrewAI environment with flows
🔗 Step 2: Connect Google Drive and Slack using composio.dev
💡 Step 3: Define your state management for multi-step tasks
📄 Step 4: Automatically generate workout Docs and Sheets
🚀 Step 5: Save everything in organized Drive folders
📬 Step 6: Send a Slack message with your new workout
🧠 Step 7: Make it repeatable and scalable for any routine

This project is a game-changer if you want to understand how to build real-world AI automations using CrewAI. Whether you're new to flows or looking to supercharge your AI tools, this is the perfect project to get hands-on.

👇 Let me know what you've created!
